# FertilityRQ
We study the impact of having a child on the relationship quality of couples. We adopt a pseudo-experimental approach and carry out an event study analysis around first child birth. There is a sharp and permanent decrease in RQ immediately after birth, both for fathers and mothers. Illustratively, individuals ranking in the 90th percentile of RQ before having a child are pushed down to the median after birth.  This effect is induced by a reduction in the amount of time spent together and by an increase and reallocation of housework, which disproportionately increases women's burden. Preliminary evidence on the UK Shared Parental Leave suggests that policies encouraging egalitarian distributions of housework can mitigate the negative impact of childbirth on relationshipÂ quality.
